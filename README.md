# NYEstimating — Quick Links

Small static site that provides quick links to NY Estimating pages. Good as a lightweight landing page to host on GitHub Pages or include in project documentation.

## Files

- `index.html` — Simple responsive landing page with links to the four target URLs.
- `style.css` — Minimal, modern CSS for the page.

## How to use

1. Create a new GitHub repository (or use an existing one).
2. Add `index.html` and `style.css` to the repository root.
3. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings and set the site source to the `main` (or `master`) branch root. The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Customization

- Edit the anchor URLs in `index.html` to point to different targets.
- Replace copy, logo, or colors in `style.css` to match your branding.

## License

Use freely. If you want, add a license file (e.g. `LICENSE` with MIT) to the repo.
